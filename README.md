# Multi-Themed Tic Tac Toe

Welcome to the Multi-Themed Tic Tac Toe repository! This is not just your regular game of Tic Tac Toe; it's a versatile version that lets you choose from different festive themes to play with. Whether you're in the mood for some Halloween spookiness, Christmas cheer, or Valentine's love, this game has got you covered!

## Description

This project is a simple web-based Tic Tac Toe game that comes in three different themes:

- Halloween üéÉ
- Christmas üéÑ
- Valentine's Day ‚ù§Ô∏è

Players can choose their preferred theme and play Tic Tac Toe with themed emojis as markers.

## Features

- Three different festive themes to choose from.
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile browsers.
- Customized emojis for each theme to mark the Tic Tac Toe grid.
- Dynamic styling with CSS animations for an engaging user experience.
- Pure JavaScript for smooth and quick gameplay.

## Getting Started

To play the game, just clone the repository to your local machine, and open the `index.html` file in the root directory with your web browser. From there, you can choose your theme and start playing!

## Directory Structure

- `/hall` - Contains all Halloween-themed assets and styles.
- `/chr` - Contains all Christmas-themed assets and styles.
- `/val` - Contains all Valentine's Day-themed assets and styles.
- `index.html` - The main landing page where you can choose your theme.

Each theme directory contains its own `index.html`, `styles.css`, and `script.js` files that are customized to fit the theme's aesthetic and gameplay.

## How to Play

1. Choose your theme from the main page.
2. Click on a cell in the Tic Tac Toe grid to place your marker.
